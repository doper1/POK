The all in has a complex architecture that is supported by few classes:

Pot
-----
- Each game (group chat) has one main pot. More pots are created during the game EVERY time a player goes 'All in'.
- The purpose of the pot instance is to store all the related data to the "money on the table",
  while the data on the each player money holding is saved at the own player instance 

Flow chart
---------------

1. Player goes all in (raise all his game money/pok raise all/ pok all)

2. The player status changes to 'all in' and his money is added into the pot

3. A Pot instance is created under. The value of a pot is calculated as follows:

last round pot value (0 if it's preflop) +
The player current round bet +
all the bets in the current round that are lower then the player current round bet +
amount that is equal to the player bet for every bet that is higher then his
= value

For the player that went all-in and for all the players the has bet at least the amount the 'all-in player' bet, a new row is added in the participants table.
At showdown, this will indicate which players are able to 'access' which pot.

4. after each successful raise, call or all in- the amount of the raise/call/all in will be added to all the 'active' pots, and up the the amount of the bet of the player that went all in (which marked as highest bet).
In 'active' pot is an all-in pot that created in the current round. Between rounds the 'highest bet' of each all-in pot from the last round will be changed to -1. This will indicate that the pot value can no longer grow

6. At the end of the river- a winner is checked for each individual pot. If there is a tie on a pot, the pot value is shared between the winners. if the pot value cannot be split equally,
   a random player from the pot winners will get the reminder of it

7. At the end of the winning distribution phase there is announcement of the total earning each winner player of the hand has gotten
